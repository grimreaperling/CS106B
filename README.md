# CS106B
This repository contains the learning material for the CS106B from Stanford.
# Video
I study this course start by watching the video from Marty Steppy at youtube.
# Assignment
I try to finish all the assignment of CS106B from the Summer 2022 since the latest course assignment is not open to the public
note: if you install the latest version stanford library you may need to downgrade the version(2021) to compile the assignment for the recursion and priority 
queue. A possible solution is to git clone the stanford library repository and checkout at the earlier commit then make install the library.
# Section
I try to finish sections from the Fall 2022 since it's open to the public.
note: If you use the solution the same to me in order to compile the according homework, when doing sections, switch back to the latest stanford library is 
necessary. You may download the official package as CS106B.zip and the make and install the library.
